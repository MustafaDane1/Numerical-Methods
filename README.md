# Numerical Methods in C

This project includes the implementation of ten fundamental numerical methods using the C programming language.  
These algorithms are commonly used in mathematics, engineering, and scientific computing to solve a variety of numerical problems such as root-finding, matrix operations, interpolation, differentiation, and integration.

## ðŸ”¢ Implemented Methods

1. **Bisection Method**  
   Finds the root of a nonlinear equation by repeatedly halving an interval where a sign change occurs.

2. **Regula-Falsi Method**  
   A bracketing root-finding method that improves upon the bisection approach by using linear interpolation.

3. **Newton-Raphson Method**  
   A fast iterative root-finding method using the derivative of the function.

4. **Inversion of an NÃ—N Matrix**  
   Calculates the inverse of a square matrix using numerical techniques.

5. **Cholesky (ALU) Decomposition**  
   A matrix factorization method used for solving systems of linear equations, especially for symmetric positive-definite matrices.

6. **Gauss-Seidel Method**  
   An iterative method for solving systems of linear equations.

7. **Numerical Differentiation**  
   Approximates the derivative of a given function using finite differences.

8. **Simpsonâ€™s Method**  
   A numerical integration method that approximates the integral using parabolic segments.

9. **Trapezoidal Method**  
   A simple method for numerical integration that approximates the area under a curve with trapezoids.

10. **Gregory-Newton Interpolation** *(without variable transformation)*  
    Estimates intermediate values between data points using finite differences.
